This code crawls the  http://news.ycombinator.com homepage for the top 20 posts
and saves the links and titles to a sqlite database.

I have this running on a linux machine via cron every 10 minutes. Hopefully
pg does ban me  :)

TODO
* Add a way to tweet most recent items
* shorten links with url shortener like is.gd or bit.ly
* someday perform some analysis on the data collected
* Scrape not only the link and titles but the number of comments and the ranking
of the link on the page and possibly the submitter. This will be helpful in
determining the user with most submissions in top 20. I also need to change
the current date/time format from Pacific time to UTC.
